          <p>Lions have been supreme in ruling their territory because of their ruthlessness as predators. For centuries they have represented strength, leadership, and courage among many cultures. Aside from their ferocity, they have a soft side. It leaves us to wonder... are these fierce animals always on the hunt? Or do they have a soft side? This article will dive deeper into a lion's lifestyle, the real leader amongst the crew, and what exactly does a lion like to eat.</p>

        <p>Lions love to hang out together. As a matter of fact, they take great pride in hanging with the crew. So much, that lion packs are referred to as prides. These prides can range from 2 to 40 lions at one time. Nearly all lions are found in Africa and as too cool for school as these cats are... they still need to be protected! The lion population has shrunk drastically no thanks to the most cynical predators of all times... cough, cough Humans!</p>

        <p>Well, we're going to need Lion King to change it's main characters because they've got it all wrong. Did you know? It's really females that run the pride! Although they may be smaller, don't let their size fool you. Female lions are usually in charge of their packs and the main one's to go on the prowl. So if you see a male lion, yes run.... but if you see a female lion?! Run, run, run as fast as you can!</p>

        <p>Lions are carnivores... which means that most of their food is meat. Raw meat that is and any animal in their domain is up for grabs! However, they do have their favorites. Zebras, warthogs, antelopes, and buffalos are a tasty treat for these meat eaters. Pssst... want to be even more creeped out? Did you know that rhino and elephant babies are sweet delicacies to these beast as well?</p>
